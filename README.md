# Artificial-Life
A Comprehensive Investigation of Basic Computer-Based Optimization Methodologies. In this short study, we perform a comparative scrutinization of two basic optimization methodologies. Through two simple modifications, we were able to ameliorate the performance of the most promising of the two, the hill-climber, to achieve a performance that is more comparable to that of a much more sophisticated EDA, than its vanilla implementation.
